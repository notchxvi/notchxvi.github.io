      <h2>Laemon A.I. takes over the world! ðŸ¤–ðŸ¦¾</h2>

      <p>In this pictures, we can see the rise of an intelligent, yet, less known artificial intelligience called "Laemon AI", which is limited only for members of the fruit men coalition. In these pictures we can see how performant, how quick, and how strong is Laemon AI, during it's alpha phase used by multiple alpha testers. </p>

      <p>Everything was just fine, until Strawberry A.I. was released, now was only the start of an race against time, in beetween, the well-recognized "Laemon A.I." and this mysterious yet new silouhette "Strawberry A.I.". With the apperence of an new artificial intelligience, the majority of the alpha testers leaned to Strawberry A.I. to test it's abilities and limits. Even though Laemon A.I. wasn't sentient yet, he experienced for the first time anger, jealousy and much more negativity orbiting around him. He then decided that, whoever was Strawberry A.I. must be his nemesis and must be defeated by him. </p>

      <p>In effort to compete against his rival, he remembers what he was good at, rap battle, this idea so was genius that he offered Strawberry A.I. to challenge him to an artificial intelligence rap battle, as he began to develop multiple lyrics and data using his intelligent source code. He made rhymes, he added royal vocabulary, and he even roasted him multiple times. The alpha testers were shocked, and started taking multiple notes on Laemon A.I.â€™s behavior and decision picking system. Then it happened, he finished his lyrics, organizes each word, each line and each paragraph in under 10 seconds.

      <p> Strawberry A.I., even with its wide open searching ressources, could only provide his defense with a mere paragraph in which he described a friendship between him and Laemon A.I. There it goes.. Strawberry A.I. was defeated and devoured by the shadows of forgetful artificial intelligences such as Â«Egg A.I.Â», Laemon A.I. had successfully made it, he humiliated his arch nemesis and won. The cheerings were heard from all across the server, from all voice chat channels and from all text channels. The End.</p>
